## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This exercice was interesting for improve my JS skill. I spend many hours to write an IA but I get some bug I can't fix with my actual level. So I think to create an IA for the "Four Game" exercice who will be similar than Tic Tac Joe

### Continued development

Practice my skill on "Connect Four Game" with a better IA.
